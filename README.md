# interslavic_crash_course
This is supposed to be a free community driven crash course for interslavic to make it even easier to learn for native speakers of slavic languages..

You are free to contribute to the crash course and I will 100% mention you in the credits. The mission is to get more slavs to learn basic interslavic fast and with easily accessible material to learn and to understand. So feel free to contribute a book cover if you are an artistic person or to to contribute better grammar explanations or exercices for interslavic. At the moment the book's grammar sections are intentionally kept short to just show grammar tables, nevertheless I think that using a good grammar explanations at some places in this course would make it easier to understand even for people who aren't grammar experts.
