# interslavic_crash_course
This is supposed to be a free community driven crash course for interslavic to make it even easier to learn for native speakers of slavic languages..

You are free to contribute to this crash course, and I will 100% credit you in the acknowledgements. The mission is to help more Slavic speakers learn basic Interslavic quickly and easily, with accessible material that is easy to understand. So, if you're an artistic person, feel free to contribute a book cover, or if you have a talent for explaining grammar, contribute better explanations or exercises for Interslavic.

Currently, the book’s grammar sections are intentionally kept short, focusing mainly on grammar tables. However, I believe that adding clear and concise grammar explanations in certain sections would make the course more accessible, even for those who aren’t grammar experts.
